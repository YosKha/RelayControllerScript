# RelayControllerScript : Automated Soil Gas Sampling System

## üî¨ Project Overview

This repository contains code implementing the automated gas sampling algorithm described in the following scientific paper:

> **Amro, M., Baudin, F., Bataille, M., Delpech, F., De Backer, R., Lecomte, C., Munier, L., Mouginot, D., & de Lary, L.**  
> *Automated Soil Gas Sampling System for Monitoring Gas Emissions from Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) Sites and Natural Analogues*.  
> Published by BRGM, 2023.  
> [DOI: 10.1016/j.ohx.2021.e00208](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ohx.2021.e00208)

the project was coded by a student as part of an assignment for the Purpan engineering school. 
Please understand that the code is adapted to their request and need, it is perfectible and must be adapted for your needs 
if you want to implement the electronic system described in the article.
